        <h2>How to Play</h2>
        <p>Welcome to the Memory Card Game! The objective is to match pairs of cards by flipping them over two at a time. Test your memory and see how many attempts it takes to find all the pairs!</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Click on a card to flip it over and reveal the image.</li>
            <li>If you find a matching pair, they will remain face up.</li>
            <li>If the cards do not match, they will flip back after a short pause.</li>
            <li>Try to find all pairs to complete the game.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Good luck!</p>
